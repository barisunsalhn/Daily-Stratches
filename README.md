# Daily-Stratches

1. In my home country, we have  a state website which you can make a rendezvous with your doc. I wrote a simple Thunderbird extension that will automate this process (dermotologist are quite busy :( )

2. My country's local Amazon sometimes starts to slow down, so wrote an browser extension to download images with links. ( I might change this to Thunderbird extension , that's why I chose JS)

3. I searched for a solution to add a new calendar event from my email just by copying text in it. Unfort, Google provided No api for that yet.
